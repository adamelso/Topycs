The main idea of the project is to create a modern, flexible and extensible discussion platform for **PHP**, on top of **Symfony2**. We strongly believe in code quality, beauty and user experience. Also, we want to focus on extensibility, where the developers can modify the platform in every possible way. We want to make the extension development a pleasent and lovely experience for our community.

Topycs' development process follows the [BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) methodology, with [phpspec](http://phpspec.net/) and [Behat](http://behat.org/).
